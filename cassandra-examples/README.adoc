= Vert.x Cassandra Client examples

== Start Cassandra instance

In order to run this examples you need a Cassandra instance running locally.

On the ways to achieve this is to use link:https://github.com/riptano/ccm[ccm].
Follow link:https://github.com/riptano/ccm#installation[the installation instructions] for installing `ccm`.

After `ccm` installation you can run a single node Cassandra cluster:

[source,bash]
----
ccm create test_node -v 3.11.2 -n 1 -s
ccm start test_node
----

== Examples
